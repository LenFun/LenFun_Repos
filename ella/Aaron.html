    <pre>Education is the key to success</pre>
    <marquee> Education is the best policy</marquee>
<center><h1>Why this?</h1></center>
<p>Our society is full of many problems,Education is one of them;
 One of my primary school friends,collins was doing exceptionally well in the primary school.Since he entered the secondary school session, but unfortunately for him he started dropping.Though I will blame him because he spent much of his time watching TV.
       That's why he did not Get Good grades.
        He said that Education in a way was somehow strict and Direct and not fun.
       So that is the purpose of the website,to encourage younger Generations that Education is fun and the best policy

    <P>One day three men came together, <strong>The Gardner,The Electrictian and the farmer.</strong>
        They where arguing on who was created first.
        "It was me said the gardner" And i'm going to prove it. When God created the world,
            He put all of the pretty flowers and smelling bushes all around in the garden of Eden.
        Then the farmer said "it's a lie." When God created the world,He made all the fertile 
        soil for plants to Grow well and created the water for farm animals to Drink for healthy living.
          The electrictian laughed "HA,HA,HA,HA." It was me who was created first because when God created
          the world, He said let there be light and God quickly connected all the electric wires to the 
          sockets and suddenly there was light.
              So who do you think was created first?
