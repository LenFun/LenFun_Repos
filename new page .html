<h2>About the project</h2>

 </center> 
 <p>Our project is a very peculiar task.It helps in boosting education. reasons why this project is very useful</p>   
  <ol>
<li>It makes education fun </li>
<li>It makes education easier and faster</li>
<li>It entertains students </li>
  </ol>  
<p>There are so many reasons our project can affect people/students positively.I am sure you must have heard of so 
many people who were smart but arrested for online fraud,kidnapping,robbery,ritual and so many other stuff because
they thought education is boring wich drives them into societal crimes.But,this website can solve problems like this
because It links fun to education.like an example of my friend her name is bianca she is so brilliant she gets bored
in class that she decides to drop out.As you can see people like bianca specially needs this website.That is why we 
present BHS academic website for students around the world.
